# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

NebulaStream project follows the [Apache Software Foundation code of conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

# NebulaStream Specific 
1. We prefer to do things right and clean (codebase, architecture, documentation, reviews) instead of quick and dirty.
2. Issues SHOULD be meaningful and contain enough information that someone else can pick them up and work on them (self-contained).
3. Meetings must be prepared and there should exist action items (who, what, until when) at the end of a meeting. Further, an agenda has to be presented and sent around before the meeting starts.
4. Commit messages should be meaningful and contain enough information to understand what the commit is about.
5. Reviewers of a PR thoroughly review the PR and only accept it when they have no more concerns.
6. The author of a PR addresses all elements from the technical and non-technical checklists and addresses all points raised by the reviewers. 
7. If the author of a PR changes something in the PR, the author should ask the reviewers to review the PR again.

# NebulaStream Maintainers
1. The task of the maintainers is to give **direction**, enforce **code quality** and take **responsibility** for the project. This means that if a problem arises it is the highest priority job of the maintainers to solve it or delegate it.
2. The maintainers are responsible for **merging** pull requests and are the only ones who can merge a pull request.
3. Each maintainer is equal and has equal voting rights.
4. The group of maintainers is dynamic and can change over time. Each maintainer must contribute to the project and be active. If a maintainer does not contribute, the other maintainers can decide to remove him/her from the group.
5. Maintainers let other maintainers know if they are not able to contribute for a longer period of time, e.g., due to vacation, sickness, etc.
6. Maintainers do not blame each other. Maintainers do not attack each other. Maintainers do not get personal, directly or indirectly. Maintainers let other people speak out. Maintainers follow the majority, even if they feel very strongly against it. A maintainer may be voted out of the team for behavior that violates these rules.
