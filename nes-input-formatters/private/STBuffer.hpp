/// The STBuffer enables threads to concurrently resolve spanning tuples.
/// Spanning tuples (STs) are tuples that span over two or more buffers.
/// The buffers that form the ST may be processed by multiple threads concurrently.
/// The STBuffer makes sure that exactly one thread processes an ST (avoiding missing an ST or producing duplicate STs)
///
/// The central abstraction that allows the STBuffer to thread-safely determine STs is the AtomicState attached to each of its entries.
/// The atomic state can thread-safely denote whether an STBufferEntry has a delimiter, whether its buffers are used already, and
/// very importantly, which iteration the entry belongs to.
/// The STBuffer derives the iteration by dividing the sequence number (SN) of an incoming buffer by the size of the STBuffer and adding 1
/// e.g., for a buffer size of 1024 entries and an SN of 2025: 2025 / 1024 + 1 = 2 (see 'getBufferIdxAndABAItNo' of STBuffer)
/// Two SNs are connected, if they  have a distance of 1 and either share the same iteration, or are the first/last entries of the buffer,
/// with the first entry being in the iteration that immediately follows the iteration of the last entry
/// Two buffers that both have delimiters and that are connected or separated by a connected series of buffers without delimiters form an ST
/// The STBuffer takes a buffer and then iterates over its entries, using their atomic states to determine valid STs
/// The STBuffer guarantees that at least one thread determines a valid ST, because an entry can only be replaced with a new entry, if both
/// of its uses (part of atomic state) have been claimed. The uses are only claimed, if a thread found an ST that uses the respective
/// entries.
/// The STBuffer guarantees that only one thread can claim an ST, because (multiple) threads that found the same ST can only claim the ST
/// by using a CAS-loop to atomically set the 'claimedSpanningTupleBit' of the STBufferEntry that represents the first buffer of the ST to 1.
/// The CAS-loop requires that the 'claimedSpanningTupleBit' is '0' and a matching abaItNo.
/// Thus, only the thread that wins the race to flip the 'claimedSpanningTupleBit' to 1 can claim the ST.
/// After a thread claimed an ST, it knows it is the only thread that claimed the ST and can safely claim the uses of all other buffers that
/// are part of the ST.
