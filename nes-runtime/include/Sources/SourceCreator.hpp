 * function to create a TCP source

 * They are also subject to reference counting.
 * @param queryManager comes with functionality to manage the queries
 * @param tcpSourceType see TCPSourceType.hpp for information on this object
 * @param operatorId represents a locally running query execution plan
 * @param originId represents an origin
 * @param numSourceLocalBuffers number of local source buffers
