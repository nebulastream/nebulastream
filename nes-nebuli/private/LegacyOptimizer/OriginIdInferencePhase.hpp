/**
 * @brief The OriginIdInferencePhase traverses the operator tree and assigns origin ids to operators.
 *
 * In general, origin ids are emitted from sources, windows or other stateful operators and are used to identify the origin of records.
 * This is crucial for stateful operators, which have to make guarantees over the order of records in the stream (see WatermarkProcessor)
 *
 * This rule is performed in two phases:
 * 1. It assigns unique origin ids to all operators, which inherit from OriginIdAssignmentOperator.
 * These origin ids are unique to a specific query.
 * 2. It processes all operators and assigns the input and output origin ids.
