name: NES Nightly

# This workflow is triggered every night at 2:30 AM UTC.
# This is a good way to ensure that the main branch is always in a good state.
# For now, this workflow file runs the same tests as `pr.yml` and then creates a docker image nes-executable-image:nightly, if the test pass.
# For pushing an image to the docker hub, we build debian packages (nes-amd64.deb and nes-arm64.deb) and then use them to build the docker image.
# We will add long-running test for stability and performance checks in the future.
