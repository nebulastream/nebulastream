# The following pipeline is meant to run for every PR. It will not call any other workflow / pipeline.
# It will also apply the format check. If these steps are successful, it will try to build the PR and run the tests.
# In the future, we will add more automated checks to this pipeline, e.g., clang-tidy for our codebase or code coverage checks.
