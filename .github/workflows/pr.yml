# The following pipeline is meant to run for every PR.
# It will also apply the format check. If these steps are successful, it will try to build the PR and run the tests.
# If this pr is called with act, it has to be used with a custom event.json and called via `act -e event.json`.
# Otherwise, we are not running the job, as mentioned: https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/720
