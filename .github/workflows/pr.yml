name: NES PR CI

# The following pipeline is meant to run for every PR. It will not call any other workflow / pipeline.
# It will also apply the format check. If these steps are successful, it will try to build the PR and run the tests.
# In the future, we will add more automated checks to this pipeline, e.g., clang-tidy for our codebase or code coverage checks.
#
# If this pr is called with act, it has to be used with a custom event.json and called via `act -e event.json`.
# Otherwise, we are not running the job, as mentioned: https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/720

    # The ready_for_review event is used when a draft pr is changed into a non-draft version. If we did
    # not use the ready_for_review the ci would not be triggered and appear to have passed.
