name: NES Code Coverage

# This workflow is triggered by the pr.yml workflow.
# We are using this workflow to build the code coverage for the base branch and PR branches.
# We do this by building all tests for the base and PR branches and comparing the code coverage between the two branches.
# To get the code coverage, we use the code-coverage-action from barecheck that operates on lcov files generated by building with the flag CODE_COVERAGE=ON and running the tests.
# The test have a timeout of 40 minutes, as building the code coverage can take a long time.

  # We are using this yaml in other workflows, e.g., nightly or PR, so we need to allow another workflow call to trigger this workflow.
  # We are expecting the tag of the docker image to be passed as an output from the previous job.
