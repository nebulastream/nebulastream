# This workflow is triggered by the pr.yml workflow.
# We are using this workflow to build the code coverage for the PR branches.
# To get the code coverage, we use codecov which operates on lcov files generated by building with the flag CODE_COVERAGE=ON and running the tests.
# The test have a timeout of 90 minutes, as building the code coverage can take a long time.
