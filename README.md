# NebulaStream 

NebulaStream is our attempt to develop a general purpose, end-to-end data management system for the IoT.
It provides an out-of-the box experience with rich data processing functionalities and a high ease-of-use.

NebulaStream is a joint research project between the DIMA group at TU Berlin and BiFOLD.
