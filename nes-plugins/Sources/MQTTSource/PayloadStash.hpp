/// A simple stash for persisting partial payloads that did not fit into a TB between calls to `fillTupleBuffer`.
/// When a payload does not fit, stash the remainder.
/// On the next invocation, consume the stashed payload before reading new data.
/// The stash can be in two states:
/// 1. Empty: consumed == tail == 0
/// 2. Partly Consumed: consumed < tail
///
/// The stash has the following two operations:
/// 1. Stash a new payload by placing it into the internal buffer. This operation is allowed only when the stash is in empty state.
/// It will copy the underlying data into the buffer to ensure lifetime until the consume operation occurs.
/// 2. Consume up to `numBytes` from the stashed payload. This operation is allowed only when the stash is in partly consumed state.
/// This will return a view into the underlying buffer, meaning the contents will need to be copied out into a target buffer
/// to ensure proper lifetime.
///
/// The consume method takes care of transferring the stash into the empty state when the whole payload has been consumed.
/// The caller has to take care of consuming before stashing more data.
/// @note This object is not thread-safe.
