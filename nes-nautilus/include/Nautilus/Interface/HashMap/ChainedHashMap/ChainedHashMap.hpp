/// https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/morsels.pdf.

/// The HashMap is distinguishing two memory areas:
///
/// Entry Space:
/// The entry space is fixed size and contains pointers into the storage space. The entry space operates as a starting point for each chain.
/// This means that the entry space can be thought of buckets in a hash table.
///
/// Storage Space:
/// The storage space contains individual key-value pairs. It does not support variable length keys or values for now.
/// For keys, one could project them beforehand to a fixed length representation, e.g., uin64_t, and then use the newly mapped key.
///
/// IMPORTANT:
/// 1. This hash map is *NOT* thread save and allows for no concurrent accesses, as it does not use any locking, atomics or synchronization primitives.
/// 2. This hash map does not clear the content of the entry. So it is up to the user to initialize values correctly.
