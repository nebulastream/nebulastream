# Currently, it is impossible that these two operations (targeting the same query) run concurrently.

# Suppress false positive race conditions in standard library's shared_ptr, weak_ptr, and future/promise implementations.
# These use lock-free atomic operations for reference counting which TSAN reports as races when the stdlib
# is not compiled with sanitizer instrumentation. These suppressions are specific to known safe patterns
# and do not hide races in our code's usage of these standard library components.
# TODO #808: These suppressions will be removed once we introduce a sanitized standard library.
