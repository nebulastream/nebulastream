# The Problem
- describe the current state of the system
- explain why the system's current state requires a change
- specify the concrete problems and enumerate them as P1, P2, ...

# Goals
- describe goals/requirements that the proposed solution must fulfill
- enumerate goals as G1, G2, ...
- describe how the goals G1, G2, ... address the problems P1, P2, ...

# Non-Goals
- list what is out of scope and why
- enumerate non-goals as NG1, NG2, ...

# Alternatives
- (arguably the most important section of the DD, if there are no good alternatives, we can simply implement the sole solution and write documentation)
- discuss alternative approaches A1, A2, ..., including their advantages and disadvantages

# (Optional) Solution Background
- describe relevant prior work, e.g., issues, PRs, other projects

# Our Proposed Solution
- start with a high-level overview of the solution
- explain the interface and interaction with other system components
- explain a potential implementation
- explain how the goals G1, G2, ... are addressed
- use diagrams if reasonable

# Proof of Concept
- demonstrate that the solution should work
- can be done after the first draft

# Summary
- this section closes the Problems/Goals bracket opened at the beginning of the design document
- briefly recap how the proposed solution addresses all [problems](#the-problem) and achieves all [goals](#goals) and if it does not, why that is ok
- briefly state why the proposed solution is the best [alternative](#alternatives)

# (Optional) Open Questions
- list relevant questions that cannot or need not be answered before merging
- create issues if needed

# (Optional) Sources and Further Reading
- list links to resources that cover the topic

# (Optional) Appendix
- provide here nonessential information that could disturb the reading flow, e.g., implementation details
