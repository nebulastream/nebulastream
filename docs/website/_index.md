NebulaStream is the first data management system designed for the Internet of Things (IoT).
It is designed from the ground up to incorporate all computing resources, even outside the cloud, and apply processing wherever possible.
This is a fundamental change compared to today's streaming systems that are designed for the cloud and thus require bringing all data into the cloud before processing.
However, even though NebulaStream is designed for the IoT, it is also a highly efficient streaming engine that can be used within cloud setups.
