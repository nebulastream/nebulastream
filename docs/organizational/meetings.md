# Types of Meetings

- Every day, 15min standup meeting
- Once in 2 weeks, a sprint meeting
- A weekly blocker for a knowledge transfer / organizational meeting
- Once every 6 weeks, a milestone meeting
- Once every 6 weeks, a retrospective meeting at the end of the milestone

# Daily Standup

- Write in the Dailies Doc what was done yesterday and the plan for today
- Attend the meeting either via Zoom or in person
- Each team member presents what they did, what they plan to do next, and what is potentially blocking them to the rest of the team

# Sprint Meeting

- Make sure that the issues for the sprint are located in the Backlog column of the  [NebulaStream Public - Sprint Plan project](https://github.com/orgs/nebulastream/projects/28)
- Each member, one by one, picks their issues for the upcoming Sprint
- Chosen issues are then moved from the Backlog to the In Progress column
- Issues that cannot be addressed due to an external dependency are moved to the column Blocked


# Knowledge Transfer / Organisational Meeting

- Create an agenda in the [Core Team Planning Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ACM_F6AGJFkSxlV4PBwYES69-z1DV0yd2i4skM4IJvc/edit?usp=sharing)
- Every point from the meeting agenda is moderated by exactly one person
- If the meeting participants cannot agree on an action item, voting determines the outcome
- Every member has an equivalent vote
- An action item can only be accepted if everyone affected has voted (except holidays, sick leave, etc.)
- Write the action items to the [Core Team Planing Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ACM_F6AGJFkSxlV4PBwYES69-z1DV0yd2i4skM4IJvc/edit?usp=sharing)

# Milestone Meeting

1. Open a Discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/nebulastream/nebulastream-public/discussions) with the feature description
2. Once the Discussion is closed (the owner(s) decides on that), the owner(s) creates a design document
3. The owner(s) uploads the design document to the repository and creates a PR
4. Once the PR is approved, the owner(s) creates an epic based on the revised design document 
5. An epic encapsulates sub-epics that try to be equivalent in estimated implementation time, which is one milestone 
6. The owner(s) creates a list of sub-epics and puts them in the Backlog column of the [NebulaStream-Public](https://github.com/orgs/nebulastream/projects/26) project 
7. The owner(s) creates a time estimate for each sub-epic 
8. The maintainer team priorities sub-epics 
9. The maintainer team picks sub-epics from the Backlog column depending on the priority until it reaches the estimated time of the milestone 
10. The maintainer team decides on the assignees of chosen specific sub-epics 
11. The owner(s) of sub-epics creates issues based on the chosen sub-epics


# Retrospective Meeting

- Join the board in [Retro Metro](https://metroretro.io). The tool provides a GUI, where individual opinions are presented in a form of stickers
- Utilize individual stickers to document observations. Identify and record aspects of projects or processes that were either beneficial or detrimental, suggesting changes or continuations of specific practices
- Each team member, one by one, presents their stickers and elaborates on them
- Group stickers by the topic and begin a voting process to prioritize these groups based on their perceived importance
- Write action items based on the chosen groups
