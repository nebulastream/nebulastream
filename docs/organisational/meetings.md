# Milestone Meeting

- Open a Discussion on GitHub with the feature description
- Once the Discussion is closed (the owner(s) decides on that), the owner(s) creates a design document
- The owner(s) uploads the design document to the repository and creates a PR
- Once the PR is approved, the owner(s) creates an epic based on the revised design document
- An epic encapsulates sub-epics that try to be equivalent in estimated implementation time, which is one milestone
- The owner(s) creates a list of sub-epics and puts them in the Backlog column of the NebulaStream-Public project
- The owner(s) creates a time estimate for each sub-epic
- The maintainer team priorities sub-epics
- The maintainer team picks sub-epics from the Backlog column depending on the priority until it reaches the estimated time of the milestone 
- The maintainer team decides on the assignees of chosen specific sub-epics
- The owner(s) of sub-epics creates issues based on the chosen sub-epics
