\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Global Organisational Variables\
\
Sprint - 2 weeks\
Milestone - 6 weeks\
\
# Meetings Agenda\
\
- Once in two weeks, a sprint meeting\
- Every day 5min standup meeting\
- Once every 6 weeks, a milestone meetings\
- Once every 6 weeks, a retrospective meeting\
- Anytime on demand\
\
After every meeting, we create action items and write them to the nes_maintainer chat.\
\
# Meetings Structure\
\
- One person is moderating a meeting\
- Every meeting has an agenda and potential action items\
- If the meeting participants cannot agree on an action item, the voting starts\
- Every member has an equivalent vote\
- The action item cannot be accepted if one of the team members did not vote (except holidays, sick leave etc.)\
\
# General Flow of the Milestone\
\
1. Open a Discussion on GitHub with the feature description.\
2. Once the Discussion is closed (the owner(s) decides on that), the owner(s) creates a design document.\
3. The owner(s) uploads the design document to the repository and creates a PR\
4. Once the PR is approved, the owner(s) creates an epic based on the revised design document\
5. An epic encapsulates sub-epics that try to be equivalent in estimated implementation time, which is one milestone.\
6. For every milestone, the owner(s) picks a sub-epic and creates issues that are equivalent to one sprint of working time.\
7. Based on these issues, the owner(s) create a presentation that includes:\
	- The resulting design of the feature\
	- The estimated time of development \
	- The sub-epics picked for the milestone\
8. The maintainer team priorities sub-epics\
9. The maintainer team picks sub-epics from both the previous milestone and the backlog depending on the priority until it reaches the estimated time of the milestone\
10. The owner(s) creates issues based on the chosen sub-epics\
\
Additional sub-epics cannot be created during a milestone, they can only be created for the next milestone. \
