# Todo #442: the below system level tests currently perform downcasts.
# Since add is commutative, e.g., 'i8 + f32' equals 'f32 + i8', so we check only one direction.
#   - int8_t + int16_t = int8_t -> -42(int8) + -129(int16) = 85(int8)
#   - int16_t + int8_t = int16_t -> -129(int16) + -42(int8) = -171(int16)
# - the above follows the c++ standard, given that there is no implicit cast to a larger datatype and the
#   left-side datatype determines the type.
# Check if different numeric types support the add operation
