# Query 8 Variant (We are not using the actual Q8 but a variant, as we have swapped the Person stream with the Bid stream)
# TODO #700 The projection type inference cannot differentiate between bid.timestamp and auction.timestamp, so we removed them.
# The projection simply sees twice the string timestamp and thus differentiate between bid.timestamp and auction.timestamp.
