# groups: [milestone, benchmark, large]

# Source definitions
## We define two sources, as the lightsaber paper provides its own data file and the schema does not 100% match the original data under https://github.com/lsds/LightSaber/blob/master/resources/datasets/google-cluster-data/google-cluster-data.txt
## For example, the data from the lightsaber paper is a subset of the original data, as it only contains 16k tuples.
## Furthermore, as we are having heavily out-of-order data, we need to use float64 for the cpu, ram and disk fields to ensure that the results are deterministic for the original data. The lightsaber data uses float32 for these fields.

# These test is currently disabled, as we cannot ensure deterministic results for the queries
# The problem is that the queries perform a floating point aggregation. Due to our out-of-order processing, the results may differ slightly.
# This is fine for the query 2 but not for the query 1.
