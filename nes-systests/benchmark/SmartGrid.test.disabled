# description: Queries from the Paper: "LightSaber: Efficient Window Aggregation on Multi-core Processors (Theodorakis et al.)"
# The paper uses the dataset from DEBS 2014 Grand Challenge https://debs.org/grand-challenges/2014/ but creates custom queries
# groups: [milestone, benchmark, large]

# This test is currently disabled, as we can not ensure deterministic results for the queries
# The problem is that the queries perform a floating point average aggregation. Due to our out-of-order processing, the results may differ slightly.
