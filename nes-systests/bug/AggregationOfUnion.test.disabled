# name: bug/AggregationOfUnion.test
# description: Currently, the pipelining phase creates a scenario where the query would share the WindowAggregationBuild,
               but still have multiple origin IDs. This prevents the single terminate from triggering the release of pending slices.
               As you can see in the dump of the pipelines. Pipeline 2, which contains the aggregation build, is shared and thus will be
               terminated only once. What we want is to duplicate the AggregationBuild as the emit for both source pipelines.
               The issue is tracked under TODO #913
