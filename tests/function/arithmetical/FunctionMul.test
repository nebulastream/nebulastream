# Since equals is commutative, e.g., 'val_i8 * val_f32' equals 'val_f32 * val_i8', so we check only one direction.
# - Todo: the above statement is currently not true.
#   - int8_t + int16_t = int8_t -> -42(int8) *-129(int16) = 42(int8)
#   - int16_t + int8_t = int16_t -> -129(int16) * -42(int8) = 5418(int16)
# - the above follows the c++ standard, given that there is no implicit cast to a larger datatype and the
#   left-side datatype determines the type.
# Check if different numeric types support the equals operation
