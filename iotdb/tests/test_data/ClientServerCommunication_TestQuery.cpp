Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about,
    the speed of noncritical parts of their programs,
    and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.
    We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
    Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.
